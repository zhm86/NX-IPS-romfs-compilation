SnowRunner | IPS | romfs | v1.0.38

-Reduced image sharpness when using FIDELITY FX (docked|handheld)
-Slightly increased dynamic resolution frame time (docked|handheld)
-Texture filtering changed from linear to anisotropic (docked|handheld)
-Slightly decreased LOD bias (docked|handheld)
-Increased the distance of shadows from vegetation (docked|handheld)
-Increased dynamic shadow distance (docked|handheld)
-Disabled dynamic vegetation and object distance system (docked|handheld)
-Increased objects distance (docked|handheld)
-Reduced activation radius of vegetation physics models (docked|handheld)
-Increased shadow resolution (docked|handheld)
-Increased texture quality (docked|handheld)
-Antialising disabled (docked|handheld)
*To enable antialising open "game.retail.cfg" and change line 1716 "AntialiasingQuality: 0" to 1, 2, 3 or 4, it should help to reduce shimmering at cost of less sharp image. 
0 = MSAA off, TAA off
1 = MSAA off, TAA on
2 = MSAA 2x, TAA off <- image glitches
3 = MSAA 4x, TAA off <- image glitches
4 = MSAA 8x, TAA off <- image glitches

Notes: This mod is based on ECLIPSE00074's work, it's missing PC texture replacement and in-game graphics settings from original the mod, converted to IPS by cucholix.
